**Description:**
Cafès Roure, situated in the vibrant Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, is a quaint specialty coffee shop cherished by locals and visitors alike. In an era where digital presence greatly influences consumer choices, enhancing the digital experience for Cafès Roure can significantly augment its visibility, engagement, and ultimately, its success. This project, undertaken as part of the Master’s Degree in Design and Management of User Experience and Digital Services at UVic-UCC-ELISAVA, aims to revamp Cafès Roure's digital footprint, aligning it with contemporary trends and customer expectations.
